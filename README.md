# About Vedit
Vedit is an open source iamge editing project, written in <a href="https://www.qb64.org/portal/">QB64</a> (and bits of C++). Contributions and issue statements are highly encouraged. Feature requests will be a bigger focus in the future, when the basic features have found a place in the program.

# Development Disclaimer
As Vedit is currently in early development, the current state of the program can be broken and should not be expected to function as intended at all times.

# How you can contribute
Feel free to fork this repository and change/add stuff! If we like what you added and feel like you improved the program, we will merge it into release. Even reporting issues helps a lot for improving the software, so please don't hesitate to do so!

Make sure to move the code/ folder into the same folder as your IDE, as QB64 won't recognize the relative path.
